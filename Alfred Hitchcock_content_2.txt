Alfred Hitchcock, the renowned English filmmaker, is known for creating some of the greatest movies of all time, including Vertigo, Rear Window, Rebecca, and North by Northwest. He was nicknamed "the master of suspense" for his stylish crime thrillers. While his most well-known movie is Psycho, Hitchcock revealed in an old interview that his favorite film from his own filmography is Shadow of a Doubt, a 1943 mystery noir. The film tells the story of a family in a small Northern Californian town who unknowingly harbors a mass murderer. Hitchcock loved the idea of bringing menace into a small town. Despite his close relationship with Cary Grant, one of his frequent collaborators, Shadow of a Doubt remains his favorite.
