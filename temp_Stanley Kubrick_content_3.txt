Since Stanley is the most widely celebrated American director in history, I thought many others may appreciate a look at some of his favorites. This list itself is quite obviously in completely random order. In 1987 Stanley mentioned being starstruck by the films of Stroheim, D.W. Griffith and Eisenstein as a young man. "I was starstruck by these fantastic movies." Not in the sense of going to Hollywood and making a lot of money he stated, but purely because of these people's work he "Really was in love with movies." Kubrick mentioned many times over his career a love for Max Ophüls films. Ophüls, Fellini and Bergman were commonly mentioned as Kubrick's favorite directors. He also loved Chaplin films, but not for the direction, rather for the stories themselves. He also mentioned Kazan on a few occasions as one of the best American directors, as well as publicly expressing his love of both Vittorio De Sica and Luis Buñuel more than a few times over the years. David Lean was another he mentioned in public more than once. "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy".I'll leave you with this quote from Kubrick himself, though it does date back to fairly early in his career, “There are very few directors about whom you’d say you automatically have to see everything they do. I’d put Fellini, Bergman and David Lean at the head of my first list, and Truffaut at the head of the next level.” Refine See titles to watch instantly, titles you haven't rated, etc Instant Watch Options Genres Movies or TV IMDb Rating In Theaters Release Year Keywords Prime Video (2) Freevee (1) Prime Video (Rent or Buy) (45) Drama (57) Comedy (22) Romance (22) Crime (8) History (8) War (8) Thriller (7) Horror (6) Music (6) Fantasy (5) Mystery (4) Adventure (3) Biography (3) Musical (3) Action (2) Short (2) Western (2) Documentary (1) Family (1) Sci-Fi (1) Feature Film (69) Short Film (2) TV Mini-Series (2) TV Episode (1) IMDb user rating (average) 1 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 4.0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 4.6 4.7 4.8 4.9 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0 6.1 6.2 6.3 6.4 6.5 6.6 6.7 6.8 6.9 7.0 7.1 7.2 7.3 7.4 7.5 7.6 7.7 7.8 7.9 8.0 8.1 8.2 8.3 8.4 8.5 8.6 8.7 8.8 8.9 9.0 9.1 9.2 9.3 9.4 9.5 9.6 9.7 9.8 9.9 10 to 10 9.9 9.8 9.7 9.6 9.5 9.4 9.3 9.2 9.1 9.0 8.9 8.8 8.7 8.6 8.5 8.4 8.3 8.2 8.1 8.0 7.9 7.8 7.7 7.6 7.5 7.4 7.3 7.2 7.1 7.0 6.9 6.8 6.7 6.6 6.5 6.4 6.3 6.2 6.1 6.0 5.9 5.8 5.7 5.6 5.5 5.4 5.3 5.2 5.1 5.0 4.9 4.8 4.7 4.6 4.5 4.4 4.3 4.2 4.1 4.0 3.9 3.8 3.7 3.6 3.5 3.4 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.0 2.9 2.8 2.7 2.6 2.5 2.4 2.3 2.2 2.1 2.0 1.9 1.8 1.7 1.6 1.5 1.4 1.3 1.2 1.1 1 Number of votes to » In Favorite Theaters In Theaters Near You In Theaters with Online Ticketing Reset Release year or range to » Death (27) Husband Wife Relationship (26) Cigarette Smoking (21) Female Nudity (21) Murder (21) Friendship (20) National Film Registry (19) Cult Film (18) Flashback (18) Based On Novel (17) Father Son Relationship (17) Singing (17) Violence (17) Blood (16) Dancing (16) Doctor (16) Family Relationships (16) Mother Son Relationship (16) Kiss (15) Love (15) Police (15) Blockbuster (14) Drunkenness (14) Photograph (14) Female Frontal Nudity (13) Friend (13) Gun (13) Singer (13) Adultery (12) Corpse (12) Female Rear Nudity (12) Man Wears Eyeglasses (12) Party (12) Train (12) Criminal (11) Dream (11) Father Daughter Relationship (11) Fear (11) Marriage (11) New York City (11) Period Drama (11) Police Officer (11) Rain (11) Revenge (11) Slapped In The Face (11) Crying (10) Dance (10) Dog (10) Drinking (10) Female Full Frontal Nudity (10) France (10) Horse (10) Hospital (10) Independent Film (10) Jealousy (10) Knife (10) Mirror (10) Mother Daughter Relationship (10) Old Man (10) Song (10) Surprise Ending (10) Theft (10) 1970s (9) Argument (9) Bar (9) Beating (9) Cafe (9) Extramarital Affair (9) Fire (9) Flirting (9) Horse And Carriage (9) Infidelity (9) Love Triangle (9) Prostitute (9) Restaurant (9) Rifle (9) Surrealism (9) Voice Over Narration (9) 1940s (8) Airplane (8) Based On Play (8) Boy (8) Car (8) Cemetery (8) Church (8) Coming Of Age (8) Dancer (8) Drink (8) Epic (8) Escape (8) Famous Score (8) Fight (8) Horseback Riding (8) Nudity (8) Pistol (8) Robbery (8) Suicide (8) Suicide Attempt (8) Taxi (8) Title Spoken By Character (8) Sort by: List Order Popularity Alphabetical IMDb Rating Number of Votes Release Date Runtime Date Added View: 74 titles 1.

Director: Federico Fellini | Stars: Alberto Sordi, Franco Fabrizi, Franco Interlenghi, Leopoldo Trieste Votes: 19,559 | Gross: $0.10M In 1963 Stanley listed this Fellini picture as his favorite all time film. 2.

However, his decision unintentionally puts the lives of his loved ones in grave danger. Director: Francis Ford Coppola | Stars: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton Votes: 1,968,486 | Gross: $134.97M Stanley's fondness of The Godfather is fairly well documented. Funny enough Coppola himself wrote the screenplay for the film using Kubrick's The Killing as his template so to speak. He tried to write the film using "The Killing's writing style of completely grey characters." Coppola noted. 3.

Director: Gillo Pontecorvo | Stars: Brahim Hadjadj, Jean Martin, Yacef Saadi, Samia Kerbash Votes: 64,270 | Gross: $0.06M Kubrick: “All films are, in a sense, false documentaries. One tries to approach reality as much as possible, only it’s not reality. There are people who do very clever things, which have completely fascinated and fooled me. For example, The Battle of Algiers. It’s very impressive.” — interviewed by Renaud Walter in Positif Anthony Frewin: “Stanley raved (or what passed as raving with him!) about The Battle of Algiers, and Wajda’s Danton, over a lengthy period of time. When I started work for Stanley in September 1965 he told me that I couldn’t really understand what cinema was capable of without seeing The Battle of Algiers. He was still enthusing about it prior to his death.” 4.

In 1793, as the Terror begins in France, Georges Danton, a champion-of-the-people, returns to clash against Maximilien Robespierre and his extremist party. Director: Andrzej Wajda | Stars: Gérard Depardieu, Wojciech Pszoniak, Anne Alvaro, Roland Blanche Votes: 7,551 Also see above. According to Stanley's long time personal assistant Anthony Frewin: “Stanley thought Danton was very nearly beyond criticism and ‘perhaps the finest historical film ever made’. He loved everything about it and said he would never tire of watching the scenes with Gérard Depardieu and Wojciech Pszoniak (‘I’d love to use that Polish actor in something’).” 5.

Director: David Lynch | Stars: Jack Nance, Charlotte Stewart, Allen Joseph, Jeanne Bates Votes: 124,560 | Gross: $7.00M A well documented favorite of Stanley's. Kubrick set out to create a similar feeling of psychological isolation and intensity in his horror masterpiece, The Shining. 7.
