Stanley Kubrick, the late director known for films like A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove, had a list of his favorite movies. The list was compiled with the help of his friend and brother-in-law Jan Harlan and his daughter Katharina Kubrick-Hobbs. Some of his favorite films include Bob le Flambeur, a French heist film, The Company of Wolves, a horror adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, and White Men Can't Jump, a sports comedy. He also admired films like Silence of the Lambs, La Notte, Henry V, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Citizen Kane, Wild Strawberries, and I Vitelloni. These films were chosen for their storytelling, production design, and exploration of human emotions and experiences.
