Having directed over 30 movies throughout his career, Kurosawa worked his way through the film industry having ended his brief spell as a painter back in 1936. As a director in training, Kurosawa worked as an assistant director to the famed filmmaker of the time Kajirō Yamamoto who, in turn, nurtured his talent by increasing his responsibilities as part of the team and inevitably teaching Kurosawa the core values of cinema art. Kurosawa eventually made his directional debut during World War Two, releasing the popular action film Sanshiro Sugata. Following the end of the war, the Japanese filmmaker’s career was beginning to flourish, and the release of the critically acclaimed 1948 film Drunken Angel signified a significant moment in the making of Kurosawa. The likes of Rashomon, Ikiru, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Kagemusha and Ran followed in what proved to be a hugely successful and expansive career for Kurosawa, who would influence leading names in cinema such as Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Federico Fellini, and more. “One thing that distinguishes Akira Kurosawa is that he didn’t just make a masterpiece or two masterpieces,” Coppola once said of Kurosawa. “He made eight masterpieces”. Now, in reflection, the praise for Kurosawa is longstanding and written in the archives despite perhaps being slightly overlooked while in his prime. Swedish director Ingmar Bergman once called his own film The Virgin Spring “touristic” and “a lousy imitation of Kurosawa” and, somewhat amazingly, added: “At that time my admiration for the Japanese cinema was at its height. I was almost a samurai myself”. Following his death at the age of 88, the posthumous book Yume wa tensai de aru (A Dream is a Genius) was published with the approval of Kurosawa’s family. As part of that book, publishers were able to pull together a comprehensive list of the director’s favourite films of all time. His daughter, Kazuko Kurosawa, detailed the formation of her father’s list, said: “My father always said that the films he loved were too many to count, and to make a top ten rank. That explains why you cannot find in this list many of the titles of the films he regarded as wonderful.” She added: “The principle of the choice is: one film for one director, entry of the unforgettable films about which I and my father had a lovely talk, and of some ideas on cinema that he had cherished but did not express in public. This is the way I made a list of 100 films of Kurosawa’s choice. Below, featuring the likes of Hitchcock, Fellini, Coppola and more. Akira Kurosawa’s 100 favourite films: 1.
