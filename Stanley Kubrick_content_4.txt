The text discusses the mystery of Stanley Kubrick's favorite film. In the 60s, he provided a top ten list of his favorite films, including Citizen Kane, City Lights, and Wild Strawberries. However, he did not mention his number one ranked film, I Vitteloni, which he had a lifelong affiliation for Fellini's work. David Lynch claims that Kubrick told him that Eraserhead is his favorite film, but it is unclear if that remained true. Kubrick also mentioned that The Godfather and All That Jazz could potentially be the greatest films ever made. The text does not provide any other film titles or relevant information about the director.
