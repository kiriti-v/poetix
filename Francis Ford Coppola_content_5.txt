Francis Ford Coppola's favorite film that he directed is not "Apocalypse Now," "The Godfather," or "The Conversation." It is actually his 1983 adaptation of S.E. Hinton's novel, "Rumble Fish." This film is also his daughter Sofia Coppola's favorite. "Rumble Fish" features standout performances from Matt Dillon and Mickey Rourke and has an arthouse aesthetic, combining elements of film noir, French New Wave, and German Expressionism. The film is shot in black and white and includes surrealistic touches. Nicolas Cage also has a small role in the film.
