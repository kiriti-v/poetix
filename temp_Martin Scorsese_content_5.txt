Through his masterpieces, such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, Scorsese managed to weave together glimpses of an America that was overflowing with the filth of modernity. Scorsese’s films have grappled with various issues, ranging from comparative studies between the institution of crime and the corruption of the government to questions of spirituality and faith. Given that he was mentored by none other than John Cassavetes, another pioneer of the American New Wave whose improvisational style, it should come as no surprise that these elements bled into the artistic sensibilities of a young Scorsese. A vocal advocate of world cinema, very few filmmakers have done as much as Scorsese to spread awareness about the cinematic masterpieces produced in the world’s remotest corners. He has consistently reminded the world of the need for visual literacy, claiming that the history of cinema is far too important to be ignored and forgotten. For this, he has been vilified by many younger audiences because some struggled to understand why Scorsese cannot appreciate Marvel movies instead of going on and on about John Ford westerns. However, the ageing auteur warns against the direction in which the market is heading because it only signifies the slow death of modern independent filmmaking. An avid cinephile who immersed himself in the world of films from a very young age, Scorsese’s knowledge of film history is unparalleled. That is why he ended up selecting 125 of his favourite films when other directors satisfied themselves with a top ten pick. From his selections, it is evident that Scorsese’s mental library of films is extremely intimidating. An eclectic mix of some of the definitive masterpieces of the 20th century, Scorsese has managed to single out the essential films you need to watch in order to get a more comprehensive understanding of the history of cinema. Despite this huge list, Scorsese does have a few favourites out of all these brilliant and important works. When asked to select just five, the auteur reluctantly picked The Searchers and Citizen Kane before adding The Red Shoes, Federico Fellini’s 8½ and The Leopard by Luchino Visconti to his personal top five. When speaking in more detail about the 1963 film The Leopard, among his top picks, Scorsese justified his selection and commented: “Another masterpiece about Sicily, another meditation on eternity, and an endlessly rich historical tapestry, meticulously composed in colour and on 70 mm.” The director added: “Time itself is the protagonist of The Leopard: the cosmic scale of time, of centuries and epochs, on which the prince muses; Sicilian time, in which days and nights stretch to infinity; and aristocratic time, in which nothing is ever rushed and everything happens just as it should happen, as it has always happened.” A stunning historical epic, The Leopard, conducts a grand exploration of 19th-century social structures in Italy and the aristocracy in Sicily. Scorsese concluded: “I could go on and on about The Leopard. It’s a film that has become more and more important to me as the years have gone by.” Check out an extensive list of Martin Scorsese’s film recommendations below.
