"Shadow of a Doubt" (1943) was Alfred Hitchcock's favorite film. The film is set in Santa Rosa, California, and explores the theme of bringing menace into a small town. Hitchcock worked with American author Thornton Wilder on the screenplay, which was a thrill for him as he finally had the collaborative support to create an authentic American story. The film tells the story of a young girl named Charlie who discovers that her uncle is a serial killer. Unlike other Hitchcock heroines, Charlie is portrayed as a strong and intelligent character. Joseph Cotten was cast as Uncle Charlie and delivered a passionate yet menacing performance. Hitchcock's personal touch is evident throughout the film, as he named characters after his own family members and used his personal experiences to influence the dialogue. The collaborative process and character development in the film satisfied Hitchcock's artistic sensibilities.
