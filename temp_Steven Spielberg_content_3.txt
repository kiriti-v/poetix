If you happen to meet Steven Spielberg, you can break the ice talking about these movies. CREDIT: 20th Century Studios Jason HellermanDec 31, 2022 I am always fascinated by what movies my favorite filmmakers are watching. And since my favorite filmmaker is Steven Spielberg, seeing a list he compiled is especially nice. In The Fabelmans, we see him recreate the story of meeting John Ford. And we know he has immense reverence for people like David Lean, Alfred Hitchcock, and many others. Spielberg grew up watching and immersing himself in the world of cinema. Check out the movies he counts among his favorites.
